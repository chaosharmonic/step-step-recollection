# Step Step Recordtracker

## General Info

A workout tracker (backend) for rhythm game players. (UI still in progress.) Built using Express/MongoDB/Node.js

This is a work in progress, and not production ready. CRUD functionality is implemented, but the API is still pretty skeletal, and I'm currently juggling getting a fleshed-out UI up and running, with seeding my database so that I can actually use it for more than basic HTTP requests.

## Setup

To run this project:

* cd and install locally using `npm install` or your alternative package manager of choice
* create a `.env` file using the example in the root folder. Leave the variables as is for local MongoDB installs, or add a relevant port and URL otherwise.
